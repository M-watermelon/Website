            <h4>The story behind this site:</h4>
            <p>Previously, I had published a website using Github pages, Jekyll, and the YAT theme. It was good to have a temporary way of connecting my computer science activities, but even though I had dedicated effort to setting up the website and written posts, it didn't really feel like it was my work. So, after that site was well-established, I decided to make one from scratch. It took three separate attempts, but a year later, I finally have a site I can call my own!</p>

            <h4>Thoughts about my previous website:</h4>
            <p>It took a good amount of effort to learn how to use Ruby gems to import the YAT theme, figure out how Github Pages works (I was really new to github back then), and familiarize myself with the mountain of css, javascript, and html the theme came with. The multiple config files, backed with relatively little documentation, definitely took my in more circles than I had hoped for, but I learned a lot through trial and error. Learning through experimentation is pretty fun, after all.</p>
            <p>But now it's finally here! My own, handmade, html/css website! It's a little simple, since it doesn't have any javascript (yet), but hopefully I can slowly make it more elaborate as I learn more web-dev skills! </p>

            <h4>Future ideas for the site:</h4>
            <p>Some smaller goals are listed on the home page, but in the future there are more elaborate additions I want to make:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Try using SASS if necessary</li>
              <li>Make a now page and move the stuff on the about page there...</li>
              <li>Try using react.js when I start adding website function that need javascript</li>
              <li>Add post tags, make better article embedding on the home page</li>
              <li>Add a "go back" button for easy access</li>
            </ul>
